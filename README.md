# stenciler-ohmyzsh-custom

 Oh My ZSH! Customizations for Developing Stenciler

The repo layout is designed to work with [VSCode's dotfile support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_personalizing-with-dotfile-repositories).

Add the following to your user `settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "dotfiles.repository": "rogueserenity/stenciler-ohmyzsh-custom",
  "dotfiles.targetPath": "~/.ohmyzsh-custom",
  "dotfiles.installCommand": "bootstrap"
}
```
